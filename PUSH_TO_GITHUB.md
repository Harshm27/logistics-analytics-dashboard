# 🚀 Push to GitHub - Step by Step

## Step 1: Create New GitHub Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `logistics-dashboard` (or `logistics-analytics-dashboard`)
3. **Description**: "Modern logistics analytics platform with shipment tracking, rate comparison, and interactive visualizations"
4. **Visibility**: ✅ **Public** (so you can link it to your website)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
cd "/Users/harsh/Documents/Personal/Misc/logistics-dashboard-v2"

git remote add origin https://github.com/Harshm27/logistics-dashboard.git

git push -u origin main
```

**Note:** Replace `Harshm27` with your GitHub username and `logistics-dashboard` with your chosen repo name.

## Step 3: Verify

1. Go to your new repository on GitHub
2. Check that all files are there
3. Verify the README displays correctly
4. Check that the Sample_Data.xlsx file is visible

## ✅ Done!

Your clean codebase is now on GitHub and ready to:
- Link to your website
- Deploy to production
- Share publicly

**Next:** Follow `DEPLOYMENT.md` to deploy to Render and Vercel!
